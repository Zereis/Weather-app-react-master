## Weather App React Enhancement

I undertook the enhancement of the Weather App React project (originally from [fireclint](https://github.com/fireclint/weather-app-react)) with the goal of advancing my skills in React and API integration. Below are the key contributions and improvements made to the project:

- **Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion:**
  - Implemented a conversion function to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures, enhancing the app's usability for users around the world.

- **Dynamic Weather Icons:**
  - Added dynamic weather icons based on the forecast, providing users with visual representations of the weather conditions for a more intuitive experience.

- **Forecast API Integration:**
  - Integrated a forecast API to display weather information for upcoming days, expanding the app's functionality beyond the current day.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensured a responsive design that seamlessly adapts to both desktop and mobile devices, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

- **Code Refactoring for Readability:**
  - Applied clean code principles to improve code readability, making it more understandable for developers and facilitating future maintenance.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience in React development and API integration.
- Improve skills in implementing responsive design for diverse devices.
- Apply clean code practices for better code maintainability.

This project provided valuable learning opportunities, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and significantly contributing to my growth as a developer.
